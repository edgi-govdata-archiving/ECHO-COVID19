    "In late March 2020, EPA released a memo announcing that it would not penalize regulated industries that fail to meet their monitoring and reporting requirements due to COVID-19. Specifically EPA has said that it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"is not seeking penalties for noncompliance only in circumstances that involve routine monitoring and reporting requirements, if, on a case-by-case basis, EPA agrees that such noncompliance was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This may have a number of public and environmental health impacts if facilities respond by increasing their emissions and discharges. Our response to this memo states that the EPA’s COVID-19 leniency is [a “free pass to poullute.](https://envirodatagov.org/epas-covid-19-leniency-is-a-free-pass-to-pollute/)”"

ICIS-NPDES identifies these DMR non-receipt violations and automatically creates violation codes for the missing DMR values with monitoring requirements (D80) and missing DMR values with effluent limits (D90). EPA's data sharing policy allows states a 40-day window to report DMR values to EPA's data system; therefore, DMR values reported on time to state agencies and shared with EPA within 40 days do not contribute to permit level noncompliance status.\"\n",
