    "# Tracking EPA's COVID-19 non-enforcement policy\n",
    "In late March 2020, EPA released a memo announcing that it would not penalize regulated industries that fail to meet their monitoring and reporting requirements due to COVID-19. Specifically EPA has said that it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"is not seeking penalties for noncompliance only in circumstances that involve routine monitoring and reporting requirements, if, on a case-by-case basis, EPA agrees that such noncompliance was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This may have a number of public and environmental health impacts. See our response to EPA's memo here: https://envirodatagov.org/epas-covid-19-leniency-is-a-free-pass-to-pollute/\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the effect of EPA's non-enforcement of Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act permits? Using this notebook, you can track how facilities' monitoring and reporting of air and water hazards has changed in your state over the past few months, compared to previous years. \n",

    "\n",
    "Not submitting these reports on schedule can lead to \"Reportable Non-Compliance\" with NPDES and CWA. According to the EPA, \"DMR values not received within 31 days of the DMR form due date result in the generation of a violation code (D80 or D90). ICIS-NPDES identifies these DMR non-receipt violations and automatically creates violation codes for the missing DMR values with monitoring requirements (D80) and missing DMR values with effluent limits (D90). EPA's data sharing policy allows states a 40-day window to report DMR values to EPA's data system; therefore, DMR values reported on time to state agencies and shared with EPA within 40 days do not contribute to permit level noncompliance status.\"\n",
