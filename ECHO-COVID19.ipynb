    "# Tracking EPA's COVID-19 non-enforcement policy\n",
    "In late March 2020, EPA released a memo announcing that it would not penalize regulated industries that fail to meet their monitoring and reporting requirements due to COVID-19. Specifically EPA has said that it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"is not seeking penalties for noncompliance only in circumstances that involve routine monitoring and reporting requirements, if, on a case-by-case basis, EPA agrees that such noncompliance was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This may have a number of public and environmental health impacts if facilities respond by increasing their emissions and discharges. Our response to this memo states that the EPA’s COVID-19 leniency is [a “free pass to pollute.](https://envirodatagov.org/epas-covid-19-leniency-is-a-free-pass-to-pollute/)”\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this notebook, you can track how facilities' releases—as well as monitoring and reporting—of air and water hazards has changed in your state over the past few months, compared to previous years. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three scenarios we may see playing out:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Monitoring and reporting violations_\n",
    "- 1. **Facilities that do *not* report** (we can track this)....**but do still meet their permit limits** (yet we can't know this specifically, precisely because they didn't report)\n",
    "- 2. **Facilities that do *not* report** (we can track this)....**and actually exceed their limits** (yet we can't know this specifically, precisely because they didn't report)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Environmental violations_\n",
    "- 3. **Facilities that do meet their reporting obligations** BUT they **report having exceeded their permitted limits**. In this case, we can also track whether EPA takes any enforcement action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also see facilities that both meet their reporting obligations and do not exceed their permitted limits. These facilities may still pose a risk to community and environmental health but are not the focus of this investigation. Please see…\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation relies upon data from the EPA’s Enforcement & Compliance History Online (ECHO), the primary open data portal supplied by the EPA, and a major basis for EPA’s decisions around enforcement. Please see EPA’s “About the Data” page for known limitations on the data’s quality and completeness. Link to data source (https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads#downloads) and limitations (https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data)\n",
